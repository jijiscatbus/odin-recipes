    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A humble, hearty spaghetti—just like the one Gina might have served
        Porco on a quiet afternoon at the Adriano. This dish captures the
        essence of Porco Rosso: rustic, sun-drenched, and comforting, with
        just a touch of melancholy. A meal best made slowly, with music
        playing and nothing urgent to do, this tomato-based pasta feels like
        an edible poem to lost time, long conversations, and slow flights
        home. The kind of food that carries you—gently—into your next scene.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil to coat the bottom of the pot and a little for the pasta</li>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ large white onion, diced</li>
        <li>2–3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2–3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon Italian spices</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon (or less) sugar</li>
        <li>½ lb of spaghetti</li>
        <li>Fresh sweet basil (optional, to taste)</li>
      </ul>
      


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-low heat. Add the diced onions and  
            cook for 3–5 minutes, until they are soft and slightly translucent  
            (but not browned).</li>
      
        <li>Add the garlic and continue cooking on low heat for another  
            3 minutes. Everything should be soft and lightly golden—avoid  
            browning, as it will turn bitter.</li>
      
        <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and cook over medium-low heat  
            for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
      
        <li>Add the bay leaves, Italian spices, salt, and pepper. If you have  
            fresh basil, add it here. Stir everything together and let it  
            simmer for another 10–15 minutes. Start with a small amount of  
            seasoning and adjust gradually—it's easier to add than to remove.</li>
      
        <li>Taste the sauce and adjust as needed. Add a small pinch of sugar  
            to balance the acidity. Simmer for another 5 minutes, then turn  
            off the heat and let the sauce rest.</li>
      
        <li>While the sauce rests, bring a pot of water to a boil for the  
            pasta. Once boiling, add a pinch of salt and a dash of oil to  
            prevent sticking and add flavor.</li>
      
        <li>Cook the spaghetti until al dente, about 9–10 minutes. If you  
            prefer softer pasta, leave it in slightly longer.</li>
      
        <li>Strain the pasta. If the sauce has cooled, reheat it gently  
            before serving. Toss the pasta with the sauce, and it's ready  
            to serve.</li>
      
        <li>This dish is even better if the sauce is simmered longer or  
            rested for a few hours. On Sundays, we often let it sit for  
            2–3 hours—especially when paired with meatballs or braciole.</li>
