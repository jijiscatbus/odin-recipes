    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Inspired by the charming seaside town in Kiki’s Delivery Service, this
        herring and vegetable pie captures the warmth of baked hospitality and
        the quiet magic of small, meaningful acts. Just as Kiki delivers this
        homemade dish to a customer on a windy, rain-soaked evening, this recipe
        invites you into a cozy kitchen filled with the scent of mustard and
        melted butter, where hard work and heartfulness become part of the
        flavor. It’s a celebration of resilience, kindness, and the nourishing
        power of simple meals—especially when shared.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 fillets of herring, or 3 fillets of another larger white fish
            (rockfish, sole, tilapia, or cod all work well)</li>
        <li>1 leek</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes (bakers or russets)</li>
        <li>2 cups spinach</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons deli-style or whole-grain mustard</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pepper</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the potatoes and place them in a pot of boiling water.  
            Boil for 5 minutes, then add 2 eggs and boil for another  
            5 minutes.</li>
      
        <li>Remove the eggs, strain the potatoes, and mash them with  
            2/3 cup of milk. Set aside about one potato’s worth of mash.</li>
      
        <li>Slice the vegetables and hardboiled eggs. Sauté them in a  
            pan with oil or butter and the bay leaves.</li>
      
        <li>Add the remaining milk, reserved mashed potatoes, mustard,  
            salt, and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring  
            occasionally, until the mixture thickens. Remove bay leaves  
            and pour the filling into a casserole dish on top of the  
            mashed potato layer.</li>
      
        <li>Cut the fish into 3-inch chunks and nestle them into  
            the filling.</li>
      
        <li>Unroll the pie crust and place it over the top. For extra  
            flair, cut the crust into strips and decorate with a fish  
            cutout—just like in <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em>.</li>
      
        <li>Beat the remaining egg and brush it over the crust.</li>
      
        <li>Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20–30 minutes or until the crust  
            is golden and crisp to your liking.</li>
      </ol>
