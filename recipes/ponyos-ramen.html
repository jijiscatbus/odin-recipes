    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This ramen is inspired by the warm, cozy moment in <em>Ponyo on the  
        Cliff</em> when Sosuke’s mother prepares a comforting bowl of instant  
        noodles topped with love (and ham). It’s simple, nourishing, and  
        nostalgic—perfect for stormy nights, sleepy afternoons, or when the  
        world feels just a bit too much. Like the film itself, this dish is a  
        celebration of small joys, made with care and eaten quickly, before  
        the noodles go soggy.
      </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 instant ramen noodle packet (any kind you like)</li>
        <li>1 egg, hard or soft boiled</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 piece of ham, cut in half</li>
        <li>2.5 cups water</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Prep the ingredients: Hard or soft boil the egg and cut it  
      in half. Slice the green onion and cut the ham into two  
      pieces.</li>

  <li>Boil 2.5 cups of water in a kettle or on the stove.</li>

  <li>Place the ramen noodles into a bowl. If your ramen packet  
      comes with a seasoning packet, open it and add it to the  
      bowl now.</li>

  <li>Pour the boiling water into the bowl over the noodles. Cover  
      the bowl and let it sit for 3–5 minutes, or according to  
      the instructions on your ramen package.</li>

  <li>Once the noodles are cooked, uncover and gently separate  
      them with chopsticks or a fork. Stir well to mix the  
      seasoning into the broth.</li>

  <li>Top the ramen with the halved egg, sliced green onions,  
      and both pieces of ham.</li>

  <li>Enjoy immediately while the noodles are hot and springy.  
      Letting them sit too long will make them soggy!</li>
</ol>
