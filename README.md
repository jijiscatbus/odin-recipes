# odin-recipes

This recipe project is a miniature exercise from the Odin Project 
(as part of their foundations section). It's designed to give me 
(and reinforce) a very basic or rudimentary understanding of creating 
simple websites with html and css. When I'm finished I should have an 
even better grasp on how to structure html and style websites with 
css.

Following my initial attempt in 2023, I am restarting this course
and exercise to recommit to the fundamentals. I have a renewed
sense of drive and motivation for creative coding, and I am
approaching it with less self-doubt and a more constructive
mindset. I will update this README at the end of the exercise to
summarise what I have learned.
